Use the following README template to create your README file. 

A well-written README file is crucial for other people to properly understand what you have done in your project.

Note:  The quality of your repository (e.g., content, organization, reproducibility, transparency) will directly reflect on your final grade. This applies to the README file too. 

# Group Name

This repository is the Project for the Module M.Inf.2202 Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing of Group ....


  
## Setup instructions 
Explain how we can run your code in this section. 
Have you used libraries that were not included in the conda environment 'dnlp' which we provided? 
If so, write down the exact installation instructions or provide an .sh file for the installation.

Which files do we have to execute to train/evaluate your models? 
We should be able to reproduce the results you've obtained. 

Hint: At the end of the project you can set up a new environment and follow your setup instructions making sure  they are sufficient and if you can reproduce your results. 

## Methodology
In this section explain what and how you did in your project. 

Describe briefly the ideas that you implemented to improve the model. Make sure to indicate how are you using existing ideas and extending them.

## Experiments
Keep track of your experiments here. 
Write down all main experiments you did even if they didn't yield an improved performance. 

For each experiment answer briefly the three questions:

- What have you changed compared to the base model (or to previous experiments, if you run experiments on top of each other)?
-  How to run the experiment? 
Write down the command which you used to execute the experiment. We should be able to reproduce the experiment.
- What were the results?
 Add relevant metrics and plots that describe the outcome of the experiment well. 

## Results 
Summarize all the results of your experiments in a table, mark the three best runs:

|                |SST               |QQP            |STS                        | Paraphrase detection
|----------------|------------------ |---------|----|-----------------------------|
|Experiment 1 |45%           |...            | ...|...
|`Experiment 2`          |58%            |...           |...|...
|Experiment 3        |52%|...|...|...
|...        |...|...|...|...
## Hyperparameter Optimization 
Describe briefly how you found your optimal hyperparameter. If you focussed strongly on Hyperparameter Optimization, you can also include it in the Experiment section. 

Note: Reinforce random parameter optimization with no motivation/discussion is not interesting and will be graded accordingly
## Members Contribution 
Explain what member did what in the project:
Member 1: ...
Member 2: ...
...
We should be able to understand each member's contribution within 5 minutes.

## References 
Write down all your references (other repositories, papers, etc.) that you used for your project.
